# COMPAS-Analysis

![](images/prison_inmate002.jpg)

The objective of this project is to find the extent of bias associated with COMPAS system that is being used in many states in USA to assign a Risk score to criminals. This score is being used by judges to define the pre-trial release of a criminal.

There are several articles and entities which has proven there are machine biases involved in this system. I am going a step ahead here and trying to find what is the degree of the bias this current algorithm have and if I can come up with some revised variables which will help minimize this bias.
